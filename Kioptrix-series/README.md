About the Kioptrix Series

The Kioptrix series is a set of intentionally vulnerable virtual machines designed for ethical hacking practice. Each challenge offers unique scenarios to test and develop skills such as:

Scanning and Enumeration: Discovering services and potential attack surfaces.

Exploitation: Identifying and using vulnerabilities like SQL injection and command injection.

Privilege Escalation: Leveraging misconfigurations or software vulnerabilities to gain administrative access.


This series serves as a practical, hands-on way to develop core penetration testing skills.
