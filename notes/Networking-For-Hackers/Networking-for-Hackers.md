Networking for Ethical Hacking: A Beginner’s Deep Dive

Imagine a neighborhood where every house is connected by roads. Some houses have doors open, some are locked, and others have hidden pathways. Networking is the system of roads, houses, doors, and pathways connecting devices like computers, phones, and servers. As an ethical hacker, your job is to explore this neighborhood (legally), identify weak spots, and help secure them.

This guide explains networking in depth, step by step, while keeping it simple for absolute beginners.

What is Networking?

Networking is how devices (computers, phones, etc.) communicate. Instead of talking, devices send data back and forth using data packets. To understand networking for ethical hacking, think of it as learning how this communication works and how to spot problems in it.

Key Networking Components:

1. Devices (Hosts): The computers, phones, routers, and servers on the network.


2. IP Address: Each device gets a unique “home address” so others can find and talk to it.


3. Packets: Little bundles of information that devices send to each other.


4. Ports: Specific "doors" on a device for different types of communication.


5. Protocols: The rules and languages devices use to communicate.

 Understanding IP Addresses (The Device Address)

An IP address is like the home address of a device on a network. Without it, a device wouldn’t know where to send or receive information.
Every device on a network has an IP address.  There are two types:


Types of IP Addresses:

1. IPv4 ( Internet Protocol version 4)

2. IPv6 ( Internet Protocol version 6 )

Here’s an updated version with brief descriptions of IPv4 and IPv6:


---

Main Types of IP Addresses:

IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)

Description: IPv4 is the most widely used version of the Internet Protocol. It uses 32-bit addresses, allowing for about 4.3 billion unique addresses.

Example: An IPv4 address might look like 192.168.1.1, where each number can range from 0 to 255.


1. <b>Public IP Addresses<b>: Unique addresses assigned to devices connected to the internet.

Public IPs are visible to the internet 
Example:  8.8.8.8 for Google DNS
Example: 203.0.113.25 (your router’s IP visible on the web).

2. <b>Private IP Addresses</b>: Used inside home or office networks. 

Not accessible from the internet.

Example: 192.168.1.10 (your laptop on your Wi-Fi).


3. <b>Static IP Addresses<b>: Fixed addresses that don’t change and are manually set.


4. <b>Dynamic IP Addresses</b>: Automatically assigned by your internet provider and can change over time.



IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)

<b>Description</b>: IPv6 is the newer version of the Internet Protocol. It uses 128-bit addresses, allowing for an enormous number of unique addresses (about 340 undecillion). IPv6 was introduced to replace IPv4 due to the growing need for more addresses.

Example: An IPv6 address might look like 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334.


1. <b>Global Unicast Addresses</b>: Unique addresses for global internet communication.


2. <b>Unique Local Addresses</b>: Used for private networks, like IPv4 private addresses.


3. <b>Link-Local Addresses</b>: Used for communication within a single network, such as when devices talk to each other on the same local network.


4. <b>Site-Local Addresses</b>: Now deprecated, these were used within a specific site or organization.



Special IP Addresses

1. <b>Loopback Address</b>: Used by a device to communicate with itself (e.g., 127.0.0.1 in IPv4, ::1 in IPv6).


2. <b>Broadcast Address</b>: Sends data to all devices on a network (e.g., 255.255.255.255 in IPv4).


3.<b> Multicast Address</b>: Sends data to multiple devices at once (e.g., 224.0.0.0 for IPv4).



IP Address Classes (for IPv4)

IPv4 addresses are divided into classes based on network size:

1. <b>Class A</b>: Used for large networks (e.g., 10.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255).


2. <b>Class B</b>: Used for medium-sized networks (e.g., 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255).


3. <b>Class C</b>: Used for small networks (e.g., 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255).


4. <b>Class D</b>: Used for multicast groups (e.g., 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255).


5. <b>Class E</b>: Reserved for special uses (e.g., 240.0.0.0 to 254.255.255.255).



<b>IMPORTANT</b>: IPv6 doesn’t use these classes, but organizes addresses differently.

Practical Example: Finding Your IP

On Windows:

1. Open Command Prompt.


2. Type:

```
ipconfig

```

3. Look for IPv4 Address.



On Linux/Mac:

1. Open Terminal.


2. Type:

```
ifconfig

```



Knowing an IP address is like knowing a house’s location. Hackers use tools like Nmap to find all devices on a network.

Step 2: Ports – The Device’s Doors

Ports are like doors on a house. Each port is designed for a specific type of communication.

Ports allow specific types of traffic into a device.


Example: A device might use one door for emails and another for web browsing.


Common Ports You Should Know:

1. Port 80: For browsing websites (HTTP).


2. Port 443: For secure browsing (HTTPS).


3. Port 22: For remote access (SSH).


4. Port 21: For file transfers (FTP).


5. Port 3389 (RDP): Windows remote desktop.



Practical Example: Scanning Ports

Ethical hackers use Nmap to find open ports.

Scan a device to find open ports:
```
nmap -p 1-65535 <IP Address>

```

This tells you which doors (ports) are open. Open ports can be weak points hackers use to break in.

Step 3: Protocols – The Communication Rules

Protocols are the rules for how devices talk to each other. They’re like the grammar of computer communication. Understanding them helps you spot vulnerabilities.

Key Protocols for Ethical Hacking:

1. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Reliable, ensures data is delivered correctly.

Example: Browsing websites, downloading files.



2. UDP (User Datagram Protocol): Faster but less reliable.

Example: Streaming videos or gaming.



3. DNS (Domain Name System): Converts website names (e.g., google.com) into IP addresses.


4. HTTP/HTTPS: Rules for accessing websites. HTTPS is encrypted, HTTP isn’t.



Practical Example: Capturing Traffic

Use Wireshark to capture and analyze packets.

Filter for DNS traffic to see what websites users are visiting:

```
dns

```

By understanding protocols, you can spot data leaks or insecure communications.

Step 4: Tools for Ethical Hacking

To test networks, ethical hackers use tools to scan, capture, and analyze data. Here are the most essential ones:

1. Nmap (Network Mapper)

Nmap helps you map a network and find vulnerabilities.

Scan a network for devices:

```
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24

```

This lists all devices on the network.

Scan a device for open ports:

```
nmap -A <IP Address>

```
This tells you what services and operating systems the device is running.



---


2. Wireshark

Wireshark captures network traffic and lets you see what’s being sent.

Capture all network traffic.

Use filters to focus on specific types, like HTTP or DNS.


Why Use It?
You can see passwords, usernames, or sensitive data if the communication isn’t encrypted.


---

3. Netcat (nc)

Netcat is like a Swiss Army knife for connecting to devices and sending data.

Practical Example: Creating a Backdoor

1. Set up a listener on your machine:

```
nc -lvp 4444

```

2. Connect to it from another device:

```
nc <IP Address> 4444

```

 Burp Suite

A web proxy to intercept, modify, and analyze HTTP/S traffic.

Use it to manipulate login requests or bypass security checks.


Enum4Linux

Gathers information from Windows systems via SMB, including usernames, shared folders, and more.

Example Command:

```
enum4linux -a <IP>

```

Step 5: Ethical Hacking Techniques

Here’s how you’d ethically hack a network, step by step:

1. Reconnaissance (Mapping the Network)

Start by understanding the network layout.

Use Nmap to find devices, ports, and services:

```
nmap -A 192.168.1.0/24

```

2. Exploiting Vulnerabilities

Look for weak spots in services running on open ports.

Example: If Port 21 (FTP) is open, check if anonymous login is allowed:

```
ftp <IP Address>

```
If it allows access without a password, it’s a vulnerability.


3. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks

Intercept communication between two devices.

Use tools like Ettercap to spoof devices into sending traffic through you.

Analyze captured traffic with Wireshark.

DNS Spoofing

Redirects a website's traffic to a fake malicious site.

Example: Instead of going to google.com, users land on an attacker’s clone site.

 Port Scanning and Exploitation

Finding and exploiting open ports.

Example: SSH (Port 22) often uses weak passwords. Brute-force with tools like Hydra:

```
hydra -l root -P passwords.txt ssh://<IP>

```

4. Privilege Escalation

After gaining access to a system, look for ways to increase your permissions.

Example: Search for misconfigured files or passwords in system files.

Think Like a Defender

To be an effective ethical hacker, learn to defend against the attacks you practice:

1. Firewalls: Block unnecessary ports.

2. Strong Passwords: Enforce complex passwords to resist brute force.


3. Encryption: Use HTTPS and encrypt sensitive data.


4. Monitoring: Use logs to detect unusual activity.


Step 6: Practice in a Safe Environment

Set up your own lab to practice ethical hacking.

1. Install VirtualBox or VMware on your computer.


2. Use vulnerable virtual machines like Metasploitable or OWASP Juice Shop as targets.


3. Use Kali Linux as your attacker machine.



Real-World Practice:

Try platforms like Hack The Box or TryHackMe to solve hacking challenges.

Final Thoughts:

Networking is the foundation of ethical hacking. Mastering it means understanding how devices communicate, identifying weak spots, and testing their security. Start with small steps, practice consistently, and never stop learning. Ethical hacking isn’t about breaking; it’s about building stronger, safer systems.
